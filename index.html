        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Nicholas Liaw and I am just starting the CST program at BCIT. I have done a little bit of python and java in the past. However, I still feel a bit nervous starting this program but I hope to learn a ton in the next two years!</p>

            Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations.
            The purpose of this course is to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses.
            The course is divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits;
            (2) number systems and data representation; and (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.
